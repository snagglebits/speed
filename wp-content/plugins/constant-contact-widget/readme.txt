* Ajax form submission - no page refresh and minimizes spam.
* Cross-browser compliant javascript with no dependencies (no jQuery required).
* Lightweight code (~120 lines of PHP code) that does not slow down your site.
* No CSS so you can style it to match your theme.
* Clean and simple, with no spurious text, images, advertising or links.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin without a Constant Contact account? =

This widget is designed to add a email address to your Constant Contact list, so you will need a Constant Contact account.

= Using the Constant Contact Widget shortcode =

Use the following shortcode:

\[constantcontactwidget grp="constant contact list name" btn="button text" msg="success message"\]

If you wish to also ask for the first and last name, add nam="1" like this:

\[constantcontactwidget nam="1" grp="constant contact list name" btn="button text" msg="success message"\]

If you wish to require that the user checks a checkbox for consent to be added to your Constant Contact mailing list, add req="your consent message", for example:

\[constantcontactwidget nam="1" grp="constant contact list name" btn="button text" msg="success message" req="I agree to be added to the mailing list"\]

If you like to redirect the visitor to another page after a successful submission with the Constant Contact Widget, simply place the url in the msg attribute instead of a message.

= How do I style the Constant Contact widget? =

The Constant Contact widget is contained within a form element with the class "constantcontactwidget\_form". 

Using your favourite browser developer tool, see what styles your theme is applying to the widget, and add the class ".widget\_sf\_widget_constantcontact" to increase the priority of your style to target the Constant Contact widget.

= Does the Constant Contact Widget collect and monitor stats? =

Nope. Constant Contact Widget is designed to do a simple thing well, and do it efficiently.

= How does the Constant Contact widget help combat spam? =

It uses javascript to submit the form via Ajax, the HTML form element doesn't expose an action or method. This makes it harder for a automated crawler to post spam via the form, as most crawlers do not run javascript.
