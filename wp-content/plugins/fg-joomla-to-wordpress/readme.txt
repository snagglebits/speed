== Installation ==

1.  Install the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu => Add New => Upload => Select the zip file => Install Now
2.  Activate the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu
3.  Run the importer in Tools > Import > Joomla (FG)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get the message: "[fgj2wp] Couldn't connect to the Joomla database. Please check your parameters. And be sure the WordPress server can access the Joomla database. SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'xxx'@'localhost' (using password: YES)" =

* First verify your login and password to your Joomla database.
* If Joomla and WordPress are not installed on the same host, you can do this:
- export the Joomla database to a SQL file (with phpMyAdmin for example)
- import this SQL file on the same database as WordPress
- run the migration by using WordPress database credentials (host, user, password, database) instead of the Joomla ones in the plugin settings.

= The migration stops and I get the message: "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXXXXX bytes exhausted" =

* You can run the migration again. It will continue where it stopped.
* You can add: `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64M');` in your wp-config.php file to increase the memory allowed by WordPress
* You can also increase the memory limit in php.ini if you have write access to this file (ie: memory_limit = 128M).

= The media are not imported =

* Check the URL field that you filled in the plugin settings. It must be your Joomla home page URL and must start with http://

= The media are not imported and I get the error message: "Warning: copy() [function.copy]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration" =

* The PHP directive "Allow URL fopen" must be turned on in php.ini to copy the medias. If your remote host doesn't allow this directive, you will have to do the migration on localhost.

= Nothing is imported at all =

* Check your Joomla version. The Joomla 1.0 database has got a different structure from the other versions of Joomla. Importing Joomla 1.0 database is a Premium feature.

= All the posts are not migrated. Why ? =

* The posts put in trash are not migrated. But unpublished and archived posts are migrated as drafts.

= I get the message: "Fatal error: Class 'PDO' not found" =

* PDO and PDO_MySQL libraries are needed. You must enable them in php.ini.

= I get this error: PHP Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND' =

* You have to enable PDO_MySQL in php.ini. That means uncomment the line extension=pdo_mysql.so in php.ini

= Does the migration process modify the Joomla site it migrates from? =

* No, it only reads the Joomla database.

= I get this error: Erreur !: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1193] Unknown system variable 'NAMES' =

* It comes from MySQL 4.0. It will work if you move your database to MySQL 5.0 before running the migration.

= None image get transferred into the WordPress uploads folder. I'm using Xampp on Windows. =

* Xampp puts the htdocs in the applications folder which is write protected. You need to move the htdocs to a writeable folder.

= How to import content from one section as posts and another section as pages? =

* You can use the Convert Post Types plugin after the migration.

Don't hesitate to let a comment on the forum or to report bugs if you found some.
